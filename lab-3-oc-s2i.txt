Step 1: Login to OpenShift

First, you need to log in to your OpenShift cluster. You can do this by running the following command:

$ oc login <cluster-url>
Make sure to replace <cluster-url> with the URL of your OpenShift cluster.

Step 2: Create a project

You need to create a project to work in. You can do this by running the following command:

$ oc new-project s2i
Make sure to replace <project-name> with a name for your project.

Step 3: Grant anyuid access to default service account

Run the following command to grant the default service account anyuid access:

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
This command will grant anyuid access to the default service account, which will allow the Node.js application to run as the root user.

Step 4: Install Git

You need Git installed to clone the Node.js application. Run the following command to install Git:

$ yum install git

Step 5: Create a new app

Run the following command to create a new app using the Node.js 16 image stream and the Node.js Hello World example app:

oc new-app --image-stream="openshift/nodejs:16-ubi9" https://github.com/eraneeshansari/node-hello.git --name nodejs
This command will create a new app using the Node.js  image stream and the Node.js Hello World example app from the provided GitHub repository. The app will be named nodejs.

Step 6: Build the app

Run the following command to build the app:

$ oc start-build nodejs --follow
This command will start a build of the nodejs app and follow the build progress in real-time.

Step 7: View build logs

Run the following command to view the build logs:

$ oc logs -f buildconfig/nodejs
This command will display the build logs for the nodejs app.

Step 8: View image streams

Run the following command to view the image streams:

$ oc get is
This command will display a list of image streams.

Step 9: View specific image stream

Run the following command to view a specific image stream:

$ oc get is/nodejs
This command will display information about the nodejs image stream.

Step 10: View JSON output of an image stream

Run the following command to view the JSON output of an image stream:

$ oc get is/nodejs -o json
This command will display the JSON output of the nodejs image stream.

Step 11: View nodes

Run the following command to view the nodes:

$ oc get nodes
This command will display a list of nodes in the cluster.

Step 13: View image streams again

Run the following command to view the image streams again:

$ oc get is
This command will display a list of image streams, including the newly created nodejs image stream.
