create an OpenShift persistent volume claim (PVC) tutorial using the provided commands. Here are the steps:

Create a new file named claim-pv.yaml using the vi editor:


Task: 1
vi claim-pv.yaml
In the editor, enter the following YAML code to define the persistent volume claim: yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: claim-pv
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

This creates a new PVC named my-pvc with a storage request of 1Gi and access mode of ReadWriteOnce.

Save and exit the editor by pressing Esc followed by :wq.

Use the oc command to create the PVC by running:

oc create -f claim-pv.yaml
This creates the PVC using the configuration in the claim-pv.yaml file.

Verify that the PVC has been created by running:

oc get pvc
This should display a list of all the PVCs in your OpenShift cluster, including the new my-pvc.


Task: 2
Next, create a new file named mysql-pvc.yaml using the vi editor:

vi mysql-pvc.yaml
In the editor, enter the following YAML code to define a new pod that uses the my-pvc PVC:
yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      value: test123
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mysql-pvc
      mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumes:
    - name: mysql-pvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: claim-pv

This creates a new pod named mysql-pod that runs the MySQL container and mounts the my-pvc PVC at /var/lib/mysql inside the container.

Save and exit the editor by pressing Esc followed by :wq.

Use the oc command to create the pod by running:

oc create -f mysql-pvc.yaml
This creates the pod using the configuration in the mysql-pvc.yaml file.

Verify that the pod has been created by running:

oc get pods
This should display a list of all the pods in your OpenShift cluster, including the new mysql-pod.

Finally, verify that the PVC is being used by the pod by running:

oc get pvc
This should display the my-pvc PVC, which should have a status of "Bound" to indicate that it is being used by the mysql-pod pod.

That's it! You have successfully created an OpenShift PVC and used it in a pod.
